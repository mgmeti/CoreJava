A programming languages are usd to communoncate with machines like computer.

The program is set of instructions to complete a specific task.

An application is collections of multiple different porgrams to complete a process.

Types of application:
            1. Standlone application 
            2. Web application

Standlone application - No need of internet connection to perfomrs tasks.
                    - It single system apllication.
                        Ex: Calculator, Many softwares in computer.

Web application - Need of internet connection to perfomrs tasks.
                - It can be accessed in multiple system
                Ex: All the websites.

Layers of web application:
        1. Front-end (Presentation Layer)
        2. Back-end (Business Logic Layer)
        3. Database (Storage Layer[Persistence Later])


Types of Language Code:
        1. High level code - Source code (Human readable code)
        2. Low level code - Binary code (Machine Readable code [101010101010])
        3. Intermediate level code - Byte code (Combination both level's)



Execuation of Java Program is two-step process:
1. Compilation - a process of converting high level code to intermediate level code using compiler (javac).
        Syntax: javac fiel_name.java
2. Interpretation - a process of converting intermediate level code to low level code using interpreter (JVM).
        Syntax: java main_class_name

Note:
    # Syntax mistakes -> Checked by compiler (JAVAC)
    # Logical mistakes -> Checked by interpreter (JVM)


Platform - a device which is a combination of hardware and software
Platfrom is used to develop applications and run them to perform tasks.
Java is platform independent - WORA archtecture( Writes Once Run Anywhere)

Keywords:
These are pre-defined, unique and in lowercase.


Identifiers:
Rules:
    1. Should not start with numebrs.
    2. No space between words of indentifiers.
    3. Should not use special characters except $, _
    4. Should not use keywords.
    5. Can start with '$' and '_'.
Note: Use camelCase style while naming elements of program.
