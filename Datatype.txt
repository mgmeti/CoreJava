Datatype:
Java is a strongly typed programming language.

1. Primitive Datatype
2. Non-Primitive Datatype

Primitive Datatype:
    # It is basic level datatype.
    # It is a predefined and available in the form keywords.
    # There are 8 Primitive Datatype.
1. Integer Group - byte, short, int, long.
    Datatype - width
    -------------------
    byte - 1 byte (8 bits [2^8])
    short - 2 bytes (16 bits [2^16])
    int - 4 bytes (32 bits [2^32])
    long - 8 bytes (64 bits [2^64])

2. Floating Point Numbers Group - float, double.
    Datatype - width
    -------------------
    float - 4 bytes
    double - 8 bytes
3. Character Group - char
4. Boolean Group - true, false.


Syntax:
    byte a, b; // declaration of  variables
    short c, d;
    int e, f; 
    long g,h;
    float highTemp, lowTemp; // Single precision
    double pi; // double precision

Note:
The datatypes like byte, shrot and literal numbers are auto-upgraded to int datatype before calculations.

Note:
1. Width of a datatype should not be thought of as the amount of storage it consumes but 
    rather as the behaviour it defines for variables and expressions of that type.
2. Java run-time environment is free to use whatever size it wants as long as the types behaves as you declared.

3. bytes and shorts are stored as 32-bit values to improves performance because that is the word size of most cumputer currently in use.


Note:
1. Strongly typed language (Statically typed)
    # It means every variable, expression has a type and every type is strictly defined.
    # The java compiler checks for type compatibility of expression and parameters.

2. Loosely typed language (Dynamically typed)
