# Flow Control Statements
To control the flow of execution of a program.

## Decision Making Statements
1. if
    a. Simple if
    b. Nested if
    c. if-else
    d. Nested if-else
    e. if-else if - else ladder
2. switch
## Looping Statements
1. for loop
2. while loop, do-while loop

# FOR loop
To repeat the execution of statements.
for (<initialization>(1); <condition>(2);<Incremenet/Decerement>(3))
{
    //Block of code run until condition fails
    //Loop body(4)
}

Flow sequence:
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
loop 2 to 3 continue until conditions fails.
Note: 
1. Termination of statements are important in for loop (;).
2. State change leads to advance and branch of execution flow.
3. Whitespace is insignificant to java.





# Operators

## Logical Operator 
It works on boolean value and result is boolean type.

AND, OR, NOT

AND:
&& (AND) operator can be used in case of nested-if.
Syntax: boolean1 && boolean2 --> true only when both booleans are true otherwise always results in false
OR:
When we have multiple if condition with same block statements, we can merge them with help of ||(OR) operator.

Syntax: boolean1 || boolean2 --> true when any one booleans are true otherwise always results in false
NOT:
Used to negate the given boolean value.
Synatax: !boolean  that is !true -> false, !false -> true
